 * The CCI-400 driver must be initialized with the base address of the
 * CCI-400 device in the platform memory map, and the cluster indices for
 * the CCI-400 slave interfaces 3 and 4 respectively. These are the fully
 * coherent ACE slave interfaces of CCI-400.
 * The cluster indices must either be 0 or 1, corresponding to the level 1
 * affinity instance of the mpidr representing the cluster. A negative cluster
 * index indicates that no cluster is present on that slave interface.
